    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <p>When it comes to steak, there are various cuts and types to choose from, each offering its own unique characteristics and flavors. One popular cut is the rib eye. Rib eye steaks are known for their marbling, which refers to the fat content within the meat. This marbling results in a rich, juicy steak with intense flavor.</p>
  
        <p>Another type of steak that has gained significant popularity is wagyu. Wagyu is a specific breed of cattle, most notably from Japan, and is known for its exceptional marbling. The high fat content in wagyu beef gives it a buttery, melt-in-your-mouth texture and a distinct flavor. Wagyu steaks are highly sought after for their tenderness and indulgent taste.</p>
        
        <p>Now, let's talk about cooking temperatures. The cooking temperature plays a crucial role in achieving the desired doneness of your steak. Here are the common temperature ranges for different levels of doneness:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Medium:</strong> A medium steak is cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C). At this temperature, the steak is slightly pink in the center and has a good balance between tenderness and juiciness.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Medium Rare:</strong> For a medium-rare steak, the internal temperature should reach 135°F (57°C). This results in a warm red center with a soft, tender texture. Many steak enthusiasts consider medium rare to be the ideal doneness for a perfectly juicy steak.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rare:</strong> Rare steaks are cooked to an internal temperature of 125°F (52°C). At this temperature, the center of the steak is bright red and cool to the touch. Rare steaks are exceptionally tender but have less moisture compared to higher doneness levels.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Well Done:</strong> Well-done steaks are cooked to an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C). This results in a fully cooked steak with no trace of pinkness. Well-done steaks have a firmer texture and are preferred by those who enjoy a more thoroughly cooked piece of meat.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Medium Well:</strong> A medium-well steak reaches an internal temperature of 150°F (66°C). This doneness level has a slightly pink center but with significantly reduced juiciness compared to medium or medium-rare steaks.</p>
