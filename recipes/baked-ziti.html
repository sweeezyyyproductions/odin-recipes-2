    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baked ziti is a popular Italian-American dish that originated in Southern Italy. It is a hearty and comforting pasta dish that has become a staple in many American households. While its exact origins are unclear, baked ziti is believed to have been brought to the United States by Italian immigrants in the early 20th century. Over time, it has evolved into a beloved classic that is enjoyed by people of all backgrounds.</p>
        <p>Baked ziti is not only delicious but also provides a good amount of protein, making it a satisfying and nourishing meal. The primary source of protein in this dish comes from the ground beef. Lean ground beef is commonly used, which offers a substantial amount of high-quality protein. Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, supporting muscle growth, and maintaining a healthy immune system.</p>
        <p>In addition to ground beef, baked ziti also incorporates cheese, such as ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Cheese is another excellent source of protein, particularly ricotta cheese, which is made from whey and contains a good amount of protein per serving. Mozzarella cheese, known for its stringy texture when melted, also contributes to the protein content of the dish. Parmesan cheese, with its rich and nutty flavor, adds a finishing touch and provides additional protein as well.</p>
        <p>By combining the protein-rich ingredients of ground beef and cheese, baked ziti becomes a well-rounded and satisfying meal option. Protein not only helps to keep you full and satiated but also plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. Incorporating protein-rich dishes like baked ziti into your diet can contribute to a balanced and nutritious eating plan.</p>
